# Café Resources Guide: Customizing Your Website

To make this website truly yours, you'll need to replace the placeholder "Brew Haven" details with your actual café's information. Below is a breakdown of what needs to be updated.

## 🖼️ Visual Assets (Images)

The project uses several placeholder images in `.webp` format. You should replace these with high-quality photos of your café.

| File Name | Purpose | Current Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `hero-cafe.webp` | Home Page Hero | Large background image of the café interior. |
| `about-interior.webp` | About Page | A shot of your seating area or unique interior features. |
| `featured-coffee.webp` | Featured Item | Close-up of your signature coffee. |
| `featured-avocado.webp` | Featured Item | Image of a popular food dish (e.g., Avocado Toast). |
| `featured-dessert.webp` | Featured Item | Image of a signature dessert. |
| `featured-tea.webp` | Featured Item | Image of a refreshing drink or tea. |
